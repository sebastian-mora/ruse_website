This blog covers a niche but powerful form of AWS Phishing by leveraging SSO. This method was originally published in a blog by [Christophe Tafani-Dereeper](https://blog.christophetd.fr/phishing-for-aws-credentials-via-aws-sso-device-code-authentication/). It is also important to note this method only works against AWS organizations that utilize AWS SSO.

I find this method highly impactful for the following reasons.  

* Environment Context: high impact services and sensitive data.
* Limited user interaction.
* Relatively trusted sources and domains.
* Difficult to detect and harder to triage. 


## AWS SSO Auth Flow


Before jumping into the attack chain let's first look at what a standard use case is. 

```bash
$ aws configure sso
SSO start URL [None]: [None]: https://my-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start
SSO region [None]:us-east-1

Using a browser, open the following URL:
 
https://device.sso.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/

and enter the following code:
ABCD-A123
```


A link is opened in the format of `https://device.sso.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/?user_code=BKKB-XWPB`. If the user session is cached in the browser, they will see a prompt asking for approval.

If there is no cached session the user will have the authenticate using their sso credentials before receiving the allow prompt. Once “Allowed” SSO credentials can be generated by the user to authenticate to the SSO environment.

The SSO credentials are not normal AWS temporary creds. They only allow the user to perform the following actions. 

* sso:ListAccounts
* sso:ListAccountRoles
* sso:GetRoleCredentials

At the core of the attack we will generate a device code url and ask an unexpecting victim to approve our request but of course we're gonna get a bit fancy than that.


## The Attack

You can follow the GitHub page on installing the requirements but with a simple command can stand up all the infrastructure required for this automatically.

If you're curious about the tool architecture there will be a diagram at the end. 

Once deployed there is an API gateway endpoint and an API key for the management endpoints. All logic is done via serverless functions. 

Firs,t we craft the phishing url by base64 encoding the victim's email. This step is not necessary but it allows us to track each url click by an attribute. 

`https://{restapi_id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com/{stage_name}/?v=abcd`

Finally all that is required is that we send the link to the victim and wait for them to accept the authentication request. Once accepted the SSO authentication token will be saved to a database and can be retrieved using the API.

`curl $URL --header “x-api-key=API_KEY` URL/getTokens`

Here is a video of the [attack flow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtwLd4R5jsY).

Notice the only suspicious domain involved is the initial URL clicked by the user. The URL is the the format of an API gateway URL. That domain could be altered to use a custom domain name to fit a pretext but I prefer the API Gateway URL as I suspect is more likely to make it through emails filters.


## Impact

Users of AWS SSO can be found trivially via subdominan enumeration. Besides a target list that is the only information required by an attacker.

`*.awsapps.com`

This is also not an area that's typically monitored by detections. The detections that are available are post compromise. This gives the attack a time advantage to secure a foothold in the environment.

Even after detection there are many methods a prepared attacker could take to secure access to the environment after the SSO user is deactivated. 

Finally, SSO token invalidation does not exist. The best remediation for this is to remove the access to accounts/roles using the SSO interface. While this won't invalidate the SSO token it will remove the actions the attacker can take. Unfortunately at this point the response team will need to check cloudtrail for all accounts to see if any additional session tokens were generated as an attacker could have already jumped into an AWS account role. 

## Detections 

The two main detection points are

* sso-oidc:CreateToken
* sso:ListAccounts
* sso:ListAccountRoles

Unfortunately these are post exploitation. The best bet here is to alert of unrecognized IPs making API calls. Again refer back to [Christophe Tafani-Dereeper](https://blog.christophetd.fr/phishing-for-aws-credentials-via-aws-sso-device-code-authentication/) blog as he goes deeper into detection and offers some sample alerts. 

There is a method to specifically defeat my tool and it is to monitor for failed calls to sso-oidc:CreateToken. The tool periodically polls this method to check if a token has become active (a user has been compromised) and as a result there should be failed actions in cloudtrail. In general failed actions to this method should be an anomaly as it is abnormal a user would call this method manually.
